            <h4 class="media-heading">Role of the Court</h4>
            <p> The Supreme Court plays a very important role in our constitutional system of government. First,
            as the highest court in the land, it is the court of last resort for those looking for justice.
            Second, due to its power of judicial review, it plays an essential role in ensuring that each
            branch of government recognizes the limits of its own power. Third, it protects civil rights and
            liberties by striking down laws that violate the Constitution. Finally, it sets appropriate limits
            on democratic government by ensuring that popular majorities cannot pass laws that harm and/or
            take undue advantage of unpopular minorities. In essence, it serves to ensure that the changing
            views of a majority do not undermine the fundamental values common to all Americans, i.e., freedom
            of speech, freedom of religion, and due process of law.</p>

            <p>Lower courts have tried to figure out how far gun regulations can go without stepping on
                the toes of the Second Amendment. Their conclusions have been the most significantly
                divided on four particular questions. The Supreme Court has declined to hear an
                overwhelming majority of the Second Amendment cases brought since the landmark Heller case
                in 2008, for which the late Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority in what was
                widely viewed as a victory for gun rights advocates but which left open many significant
                questions. That means the lower courts and the lawmakers who take guidance from them have
                spent years wrangling with those matters without any firm guidance from the Supreme Court. </p>

            <h4 class="media-heading">Next on gay rights: Bias in jobs and housing</h4>
            <p>Exhilarated by the Supreme Courtâ€™s endorsement of same-sex marriage, gay rights leaders
                have turned their sights to what they see as the next big battle: obtaining federal,
                state and local legal protections in employment, housing, commerce and other arenas,
                just like those barring discrimination based on race, religion, sex and national
                origin. The proposals pit advocates against many of the same religious conservatives who
                opposed legalizing same-sex marriage, and who now see the protection of what they call
                religious liberty as their most urgent task. These opponents argue that antidiscrimination
                laws will inevitably be used to force religious people and institutions to violate their
                beliefs. This conflict is widely expected to reach the Supreme Court.</p>
