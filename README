The homepage gives a basic explanation of the Supreme Court's role, as well as
two key issues the Court is likely to deal with in the near future. A link at
the end of each item takes you to the source material. Each photo is linked
to its original source, too.

The court page shows all the justices, with a button to show you more. Clicking
the button will take you to a page with all the judges of that gender. This
gender-directed URL is handled through a view definition, along with a count of
how many justices are of that gender.

On the gender pages, there is a brief display of the remaining database fields,
including a link to a video of that justice in action.

The about-me page is kinda basic. But it uses Bootstrap elements, pulls in photos
from the web and links out to other material.

P.S. I need to learn how to control the jumbotron! It's a little much as it now
appears on the pages. But since my css won't override the bootstrap css,
I left this for a future lesson.
